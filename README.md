### Features Left to Implement

- A fixtures and results page which updates with the latest scores so users can see how the team is performing
- Add images from the Rose and Crown. Current stock photos and placeholder images and video need replacing to make it relevant to the club

## Testing 

### Lighthouse testing
-Home Page
  - The home page test results are here. A few adjustments had to be made to increase the performance, such as optimising the images and increasing gaps between sections and text to make the website more accessible

-Gallary Page
  - The results from the Lighthouse tests can be seen here. A large way to improve performance was to change the imge formats. I managed to do this for images on the home page, however to change the image format to a more effienct one required a premium membership, which could not be done. Howeveer over time when more images can be formated correctly to WebP, this gallary page will perform much better. This is what was used to convert the images (https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp)

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjamiebradford123.github.io%2Frose-and-crown-fc%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjamiebradford123.github.io%2Frose-and-crown-fc%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Unfixed Bugs
- Image formats need to be adjusted to improve website performance. Free softwares had been fully used and could not be used again without purchasing them.

## Deployment


- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

### Content 

- The format of the home page was taken from the LOVE RUNNING project, such as the landing page, Reasons to Join section and the Schedule section. The Love Running project provided a good template for these sections, which was then adjusted in order to suit the needs and style of the Rose and Crown FC website.

- The submit button used in the form section was created with help from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp. This website provided useful tips for few aspects of this website.
### Media

- The photos used on this website were taken from https://www.pexels.com/, which were used as photos of the Rose and Crown were not available during the creation of this website
