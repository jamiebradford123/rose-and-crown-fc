        <h2>Words from the team </h2> <!--Add images of players -->
            <p>
                "My name is Charlie, the captain and founder of the Rose and Crown. I started this team 3 years ago with a small group of mates who just wanted to play football and meet new people. Since starting the club, we have had great days out as a team and met some of my best mates here. On top of that, we have gained promotion into the second division and made it to a cup semi-final. I've also scored some great goals which i like to remind people of ;)" - Charlie Monk, club captain
            </p>
            <p>
                "I recently moved to Hemel and knew absolutely no one here. I love playing football and figured I would join this team so I could play regularly and hopefully meet some people. I never imagined enjoying playing for this team week in week out. Training and matches are great fun and trips to the pub after matches and our other regualar team activities have really helped me settle into the area" - Lois Fabry
