             "My name is Charlie, the captain and founder of the Rose and Crown. I started this team 3 years ago with a small group of mates who just wanted to play football and meet new people. Since starting the club, we have had great days out as a team and met some of my best mates here. On top of that, we have gained promotion into the second division and made it to a cup semi-final. I've also scored some great goals which i like to remind people of ;)"
